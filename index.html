        <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 19, 2026</p>

        <p>This privacy policy describes how the Cryptogram Android application ("the App") handles your information. The App is a word puzzle game where you decode encrypted quotes by substituting letters.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information. There are no accounts, no login, and no registration of any kind.</p>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>

            <li>Puzzle completion history, scores, and elapsed times</li>
            <li>Daily puzzle streaks</li>
            <li>Records of purchased puzzle packs</li>
            <li>Your settings preferences (theme, sound, haptics, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analytics &amp; Usage Data</h2>
        <p>The App uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics">Google Firebase Analytics</a> to collect anonymous usage data that helps us understand how the App is used and improve the experience. This data is not linked to your identity.</p>
        <p>The types of usage data collected include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>App opens and screen views</li>
            <li>Puzzle starts and completions (including difficulty level, time, and score)</li>
            <li>Feature usage such as hints, settings changes, and puzzle pack selections</li>
            <li>General device information (device model, OS version, language)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. No personally identifiable information is collected through analytics.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional puzzle packs for purchase through Google Play. These transactions are processed entirely by Google. The App itself does not collect or store any payment or billing information. Google's handling of your purchase data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> &mdash; For anonymous usage analytics as described above.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> &mdash; For processing in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. Anonymous usage data is processed by Google Firebase Analytics solely to help us improve the App.</p>

        <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests only the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet</strong> &mdash; Required for processing in-app purchases through Google Play.</li>
            <li><strong>Network State</strong> &mdash; Used to check connectivity for purchase operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App does not access your location, camera, microphone, contacts, or any other sensitive device features.</p>

        <h2>Android Backup</h2>
        <p>The App supports Android's standard auto-backup feature. This means your game data and preferences may be backed up to your Google account as part of your device's normal backup process. This is managed by the Android operating system and is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children. It contains no advertising, tracking, or social features. The App does offer in-app purchases, which are subject to parental controls provided by the Android operating system and Google Play.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
