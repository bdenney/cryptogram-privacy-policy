        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 18, 2026</p>

        <p>This privacy policy describes how the Cryptogram Android application ("the App") handles your information. The App is a word puzzle game where you decode encrypted quotes by substituting letters.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information. There are no accounts, no login, and no registration of any kind.</p>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game progress and saved game states</li>
            <li>Puzzle completion history, scores, and elapsed times</li>
            <li>Daily puzzle streaks</li>
            <li>Records of purchased puzzle packs</li>
            <li>Your settings preferences (theme, sound, haptics, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional puzzle packs for purchase through Google Play. These transactions are processed entirely by Google. The App itself does not collect or store any payment or billing information. Google's handling of your purchase data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not include any analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs. The only third-party service used is Google Play Billing for in-app purchases.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data with third parties. The App has no server-side backend and does not transmit data off your device.</p>

        <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests only the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet</strong> &mdash; Required for processing in-app purchases through Google Play.</li>
            <li><strong>Network State</strong> &mdash; Used to check connectivity for purchase operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App does not access your location, camera, microphone, contacts, or any other sensitive device features.</p>

        <h2>Android Backup</h2>
        <p>The App supports Android's standard auto-backup feature. This means your game data and preferences may be backed up to your Google account as part of your device's normal backup process. This is managed by the Android operating system and is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children. It contains no advertising, tracking, or social features. The App does offer in-app purchases, which are subject to parental controls provided by the Android operating system and Google Play.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/eebra/cryptogram-privacy-policy">GitHub repository</a> for this page.</p>
